      This is an honest and humble attempt at making a design system for pastureen.
      I am currently hoping to use this system across my personal projects to enable them to have a consistent look and
      feel to them.
      I honestly believe that this will require multiple iterations of design, but I am committed to seeing this
      through.
      As this is a hobby project, many of the important design system elements will be missing initially or just "not
      yet" documented.
      As elements and themes become clearer, I will be adding them to this site.
