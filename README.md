# Pastureen

> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
> He makes me lie down in green pastures.
> He leads me beside still waters.
> He restores my soul.
> He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
> Psalm 23: 1-3 ESV.

I aim to build my projects and technologies
on these **green pastures** which I am resting on,
with God as my shepherd.
